      <description>A hardware simulation of 4-bit numbers adder.
How the addition operates in binary â€“ example: 6 (A)+7 (B) = 13 (C):
 Below is a hardware logic diagram of a full adder, which is used to do 1-bit additions. It uses 5 logic gates, each made out of 4-6 transistors.
 There are also other ways to combine different logic gates to produce a full adder.
To operate 4-bit additions, it requires roughly 4 full adders connecting like below.</description>
